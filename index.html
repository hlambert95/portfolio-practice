                    <h2>Hi, I'm Harrison</h2>
                    <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Software 
                        Engineering, majoring in Data Science at the
                        Univeristy of Canberra. I have a passion for
                        creating efficient and aesthetic user interfaces
                        to enhance the user experience.
                        <br></br>
                        In a previous life, I worked and studied as a musician â€“
                        writing, producing and performing. I have also had the privilege
                        of working in the operations teams for Apple, and then Tesla. 
                        I believe that this experience gives me the ability to solve
                        problems from a creative and professional perspective. 
                        <br><br>
                        I love learning, I love solving problems to make people's lives
                        easier, and I love to create. Thanks for visiting, and please get
                        in touch if you'd like to chat!<br>
                        - Harrison

                        This is a project that I worked on in my spare time. It is a
                        website that I created for a friend who is a photographer. The
                        website is a simple, yet elegant design that showcases the
                        photographer's work. The website is fully responsive and
                        works on all devices.
